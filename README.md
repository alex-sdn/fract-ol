*Project from 42's Common Core, finished in February 2023.*

# fract-ol
First graphics project at 42, it introduces the school's graphical library *MiniLibX*.

The goal is to display fractals, mainly the Mandelbrot set, Julia set and Burning Ship set, with colors representing depth and the ability to zoom in/out "infinitely" (within the limits of doubles).

### Examples
![Julia (c = 0.285 + 0.01i)](/img/julia.png)

<sup>Julia (c = 0.285 + 0.01i)</sup>



![Mandelbrot (zoomed in)](/img/mandelbrot.png)

<sup>Mandelbrot (zoomed in)</sup>


![Burning Ship](/img/burningship.png)

<sup>Burning ship</sup>
